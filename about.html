        <h2>What I do<span> </span></h2>
        <h3>Graphic and web design for creatives</h3>
        <p>I help you navigate through the stages of the business that make you feel overwhelmed, frustrated or lost. Yes, the technical stuff. I will take that pressure off you. I have a sixth sense for understanding brands and translating them visually, and I am passionate about creating beautiful graphic and web designs that will be super easy for you to update.</p>

        <h2>Who you are</h2>
        <h3>Someone passionate about doing what you’re meant to do</h3>
        <p>You are an entrepreneur, a creative, a coach… anyone with a project you feel passionate about. You know how to do your thing, but designing your branding and website is off your comfort zone. It’s time to forget the scary stories you’ve heard about dealing with the web design process, and empower yourself and your business with the perfect website.</p>

      <h2>Working together</h2>
      <h3>Collaborating makes magic happen</h3>
      <p>I’m committed to make you love this part of the process as much as you enjoy doing your thing. Let’s not forget that the essential part of the story is your business, what you do, your dream, what makes you click and smile. But I do believe that when you visually translate that into a beautiful and aligned graphic or web design, the impact you create on others, and on your business, is exponential. It helps you gain clarity and get your business noticed in a matter of seconds. It allows your clients to easily understand what you do and feel connected immediately. I will be incredibly honoured to help you get closer to the life you want and create the website of your dreams. We’re in this together.</p>

    <h3>Hi there!</h3>
    <p>I’m Angels (yes, that’s my real name!), a heart-driven entrepreneur in the pursuit of creating beautiful things. Originally from Barcelona, I’ve lived the Australian dream - but these days I’m a nomad chasing the sun while finding connection with myself and other inspiring souls. In the past 5 years I’ve worked in the film industry and played with creating an ethical fashion label, only to find myself having too much fun learning to create websites (I know, <span class="italics">freak</span>) and designing brands and identities for other people. I love organic chocolate, cool stationery, Pocahontas and new moons. Seeing other people chasing their dreams fiercely and lovingly literally gives me goosebumps. So I’m honoured and grateful to have you here. </p>
    <p>With love and light,</p>
