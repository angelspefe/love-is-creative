      <h2>Do you work with clients from around the world?</h2>
      <div class="dropdown-content relative">
        <p>Sure I do! I’ve been a nomad for the past 2 years - so I fully embrace the idea of a world without borders. That being said, I will be happy to work with you no matter where you’re based - if we can’t meet face-to-face, we’ll get on Skype and email and create a smooth communication system.</p>

     <h2>How do we get started?</h2>
     <div class="dropdown-content relative">
       <p>After you’ve <a href="/contact">contacted me</a>, we’ll schedule a 30 minute friendly Skype call (over a green tea on my end) to see if we’re a good match and get clear if you have any questions. After we’ve both made up our mind, I’ll send through an agreement and an invoice. I will require a 50% deposit so I can book you in my calendar and we’ll get the party started. So exciting!</p>

    <h2>What’s the work process?</h2>
    <div class="dropdown-content relative">
      <p>After we’re all good to go, I’ll send you an in-depth questionnaire to get fully acquainted with your project (trust me, it will even help you get more clear on your business). After the questionnaire, the process will vary depending on if it’s a graphic or a web design job. In a <span class="underline">graphic design</span> job, I will send you 2-3 design concepts for you to review, and I will then work on refining the designs based on your feedback, up to the agreed number of revisions. In a <span class="underline">web design</span> job, I will present a design and layout concept that will need to be 100% approved before moving to coding (aka making your site real). Once the final payment is made, I’ll send over the final files, or get your website online and hand over the ‘keys’ for you to update it in the future (unless you book a maintenance add-on - in that case, relax as I take care of your online persona). Last but not least, time to celebrate - can I suggest we share a virtual brownie?</p>

   <h2>How do I pay?</h2>
   <div class="dropdown-content relative">
     <p>I accept payment via credit card (with 2.5% surcharge) and bank transfer - have you met <a href="http://https://transferwise.com">Transferwise</a> for International transactions? (I love them!).</p>

    <h2>What do I need to provide?</h2>
    <div class="dropdown-content relative">
      <p>Apart from answering the in-depth questionnaire I’ll send you at the start, if it’s a web design project you’ll need to send me the text and photos for your website as soon as possible. Without them, I will not be able to start working on the web design, as knowing what content needs to be accommodated will help create the best website for your needs. If you need copywriting services, I provide them in Spanish and Catalan at an extra cost. Feel free to send me an email to enquire more about it.</p>

    <h2>What if I need something that’s not listed in your packages?</h2>
    <div class="dropdown-content relative">
      <p>If you are envisioning something more specific or different, hit me an email and let me know what you’re looking for, so I can send you a custom quote. I would still LOVE to work with you!</p>
