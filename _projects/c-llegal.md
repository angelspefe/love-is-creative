C&Llegal is a newborn marketing agency that creates a bridge for companies from Latin America and Europe. Based in Madrid, it’s founded by two of the most lovely and fun women I’ve ever met, Alejandra and Judith. I’ve been close friends with Judith for over 5 years, so when she approached me with the proposal to create the website for their business I couldn’t be more excited. I feel very inspired to see them start this journey building a business that plays their strengths and passions, creating the life they dream of, while having a whole lot of fun.

Alejandra and Judith needed a simple website that would help them get their business rolling as soon as possible. They only needed to showcase basic information: what their business was about, an introduction to them as founders, a list of services and a contact section. I envisioned a one-page website that would visually play with the branding of their business, which they already had, and would introduce some design and composition elements they had in mind. I chose a neutral stock image (from my favourite stock library unsplash.com) and designed the website in [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org){:target="_blank"} using their branded dark shade of pink as a highlight colour.

Head to [C&Llegal's website](http://www.cyllegal.com){:target="_blank"} to see it live. I hope you like it!
