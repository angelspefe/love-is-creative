service: Full Brand &amp; Web Package
description: Sit back and relax. You did your job, so you deserve getting an extra hand with creating your brand image and the website that will bring your business alive (so you can finally start living your passion). I genuinely recommend that the brand strategy, logo and website are cooked in the same kitchen, so you achieve optimum consistency, understanding of the brand and time efficiency.

testimonial: Angels is THE web designer that you need. I recognised that I really needed a website for my growing company, but the thought of having to create one myself completely stressed me out. Angels swooped in and saved the day. Not only did she suggest wonderful ideas of the direction of the website, but I felt that it was such a collaborative project- whilst relieving my stress and handling everything, Angels made me feel included in the process. Truly, I couldn’t have asked for a better web designer. And the word 'thrilled' does not personify how I feel about the finished product she produced- the website she created has exceeded my wildest dreams. Thank you Angels for helping me achieve my dreams!
